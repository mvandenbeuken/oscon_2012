## About the Speaker

Works on PhoneGap => most specifically Android

## The Problem

It used to be a mobile device problem. Now it centers on the sheer number of resolutions out there.

## Concerns

* Mulitple versions (might not be possible)
* CSS media queries
* Multiple web assets
* Viewport meta tags
* Javascript APIs

## Viewport

See android design guides

target-densitydpi is going away

height=device-height
width=device-width

## Conclusion

* A mix of CSS media queries, seperate assets and javascript can help
* Test on multiple devices (if possible), or emulators (if necessary)
* Don't give up!
