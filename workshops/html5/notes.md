## Browser support

Let's be critical of whether or not we need to support old, less feature-rich browsers

## Feature detection

Use feature detection rather than browser detection

Creating elements and looking for properties - convenience methods

Why do it? Browsers are evolving. Feature detection is organic. Not assuming that a specific

browser cannot do something can lead to unnecessary constraints on behaviour if the browser

evolves and **can** do that thing
